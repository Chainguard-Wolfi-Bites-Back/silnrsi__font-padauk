This project forms a template for font building.

To bootstrap the project, type:

templates/build padauk.cfg

then use make and try the following targets:

make all
make test # requires xetex
make testsvg # requires grsvg (http://scripts.sil.org/svn-public/graphite/grutils/)
make testclean
make pdfs
make dist
make exe
make dist-src
make clean
make dist-clean

Distributors please note that only the fonts in the top level directory should
be installed. The fonts in the font-source directory do not have the 
graphite and opentype rules needed for correct rendering.
