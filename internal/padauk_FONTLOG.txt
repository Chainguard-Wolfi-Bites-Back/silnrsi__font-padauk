Basic Font Information
Padauk is a Myanmar font covering all currently used characters in the
Myanmar block. The font aims to cover all minority language needs. At

includes the source GDL code for the description. All questions and
contributions should be sent to Martin Hosken

Features of the font are:
 . complete coverage of Myanmar script
